# Question-Answering Model and image summarization with Gradio

This project uses a pre-trained `DistilBERT` model from Hugging Face's Transformers library to perform question-answering based on a given context. The user can input a context and a question, and the model will provide the answer. The web interface is built using **Gradio**.

## Project Structure

```
qa-project/
│
├── app.py               # Main Python file for running the Gradio app

└── README.md             # Documentation about the project
```

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `gradio`
- `transformers`
- `torch`



## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd qa-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies using:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To start the Gradio app:

```bash
python app.py
```

Once the app is running, it will generate a URL (e.g., `http://localhost:7860/`) which you can open in your browser to interact with the model.

## Example

1. **Context**: 
   "The Eiffel Tower is located in Paris, France. It was completed in 1889 and stands 324 meters tall."
   
2. **Question**: 
   "Where is the Eiffel Tower located?"

3. **Model Answer**: 
   "Paris, France."

## Sharing the App

If you want to share your Gradio app with others (publicly accessible), you can use the `share=True` option when launching the interface. The command is already included in `app.py`, so you will get a shareable link automatically.
